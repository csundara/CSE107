This is a reflection of the preliminary thinking typically done prior to
actually completing any code in the given python assignment. This is specific
to lab 8 Exercise 6.1 (design, palindrome.py), as per request via the pdf.

Given that the function needs to be recursive it would be simplest to first
compare the first and the last elements in the string. Then call the same
function for a sub-string made up of all elements minus the first and last
elements.

pseudo code:

letter_comp(word)
    if size(word) < 2
        true
    else if (word[first] = word[last])
        letter_comp(word - word[first] - word[last])
    else
        false
