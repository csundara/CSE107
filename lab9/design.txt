This is a reflection of the preliminary thinking typically done prior to
actually completing any code in the given python assignment. This is specific
to lab 9 Exercise 3.2 (design, simplediff.py), as per request via the pdf.

For this exercise: first, I'll open the files with the read option. Next, I'll
read one line from each file at a time and compare them. If they are the same,
move on. If not, I'll print them.

pseudo code:
open(file1, 'r')
open(file2, 'r')

linef1 = file1.readline()
linef2 = file2.readline()

while linef1 && linef2:
    if linef1 != linef2:
        print(linef1)
        print(linef2)
    linef1 = file1.readline()
    linef2 = file2.readline()
