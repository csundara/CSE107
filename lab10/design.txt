This is a reflection of the preliminary thinking typically done prior to
actually completing any code in the given python assignment. This is specific
to lab 10 Exercise 5.2 (design, piglatin.py), as per request via the pdf.

Not sure how to setup the program so it can take a filename and my code to
write to. Will probably execute that last. Going to start with single word
translation then use that function to conduct full sentence translation.

def trans_word(word)
    if word[1] is vowel
        return word + 'way'
    else
        return word[2:] + word[1] + 'ay'


Note:
strip() in piglatin.py does nothing
turtle stuck in infinite loop in navigate3.py
