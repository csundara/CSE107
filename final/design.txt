This is a reflection of the preliminary thinking typically done prior to
actually completing any code in the given python assignment. This is specific
to Final Project: Contacts, as per request via the pdf.

It looks like the client wants an app that organizes their contacts and makes
the information in their contact list easily accessible. The main function
will manage user input and requests. Each user command will be executed by
writing a function per command and will be set up to be called using a series
of is statements and a while loop. All information will be stored in a
dictionary

pseudo code:

about()
    print

info()
    print
    print

list()
    print

remove()
    change list
    return dictionary

main()
    welcome! input
    while(input != exit)
        if(about)
            about()
        elif(info)
            info()
        elif(list)
            list()
        elif(remove)
            input_who
            remove(input_who)
        else
            error
        new input
